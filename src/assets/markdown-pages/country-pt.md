Portugal is an easygoing country. People here always find time for things like surfing, dinners with friends, a cup of coffee and long conversations. If you study in Portugal, make the most of the great coastline and the warm weather. The country is cheap, cheerful, and lots of fun. The parties go on until sunrise, sometimes beyond that.
