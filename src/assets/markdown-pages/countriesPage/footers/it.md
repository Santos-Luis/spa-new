<p>The University of Bologna is considered the oldest university of the world, but the atmosphere here is far from being classical. The heart of <a href="/accommodation/bologna" title="Accommodation in Bologna">Bologna</a> is lively, fun-loving and revolutionary. We also have student accommodation in <a href="/accommodation/rome">Rome</a>, <a href="/accommodation/milan">Milan</a>, <a href="/accommodation/florence">Florence</a>, <a href="/accommodation/turin">Turin</a>.</p>
