The University of Bologna is considered the oldest university of the world, but the atmosphere here is far from being classical. The heart of [Bologna](/accommodation/bologna "Accommodation in Bologna") is lively, fun-loving and revolutionary. We also have student accommodation in [Rome](/accommodation/rome "Accommodation in Rome"), [Milan](/accommodation/milan "Accommodation in Milan"), [Florence](/accommodation/florence "Accommodation in Florence"), [Turin](/accommodation/turin "Accommodation in Turin").
