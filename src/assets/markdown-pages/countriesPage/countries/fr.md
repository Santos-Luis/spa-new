France is a country for artists, romantics, and foodies. Of course, it has incredible wine, cheese, croissants and baguettes! But it’s so much more than that because of the way so many cultures meet: in France you can enjoy music and food from all over the world.

Besides all the other great cities and small towns, if you come to study in France, consider studying in [Paris](/accommodation/paris). It’s possibly the most beautiful city in the world. Studying here is a privilege - make the most of it! Or maybe even [Lille](/accommodation/lille), named the coolest city in France thanks to its young population of over 100,00 students!
